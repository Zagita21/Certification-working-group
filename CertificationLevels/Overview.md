# New Certification Levels for Smart Contracts on Cardano

## Introduction

Certification plays a crucial role in ensuring high assurance and quality when developing decentralized applications (DApps) and working with smart contracts. For the Cardano blockchain, certification brings confidence in the source code's quality, security, and behavior. It involves security checks before deployment and continual auditing of smart contracts as they are updated. This article presents the topic of certification for smart contracts on Cardano, introducing three levels of certification to provide different assurances and auditing capabilities.

## What is Certification?

Certification is a process that involves verifying and validating the quality, security, and compliance of smart contracts in DApps. It aims to protect user funds and maintain project reputations by identifying and addressing coding errors and potential exploits. The certification program on Cardano will be designed to comply with industry best practices, assuring users that DApps have undergone rigorous checks.

## The Three Levels of Certification

The certification program for DApps on Cardano consists of three levels, each offering a distinct set of assurances and auditing methodologies. These levels complement each other and can be applied according to the specific needs of the DApp.

### Level One: Automated Tooling

- This certification level gives *continual assurance* about the range of properties of smart contact. It covers the discovery of different types of issues or bugs that can be covered by automated tool.
- This certification level provides continuous assurance for a range of properties in smart contracts.
- It involves using automated tools to discover various types of issues or bugs.
- The process is characterized as low cost, low effort, and accessible to everyone, while offering a substantial level of assurance.
- It allows for repeated and automatic testing during each release or sub-release of an application, ensuring that the expected properties are maintained.

### Level Two: In-Depth Audit

- This level involves a manual audit and verification of smart contracts within the DApp.
- The testing is conducted at a much deeper level, addressing the technology and processes that led to the DApp's production.
- It requires more manual effort and can encompass DApps written in different programming languages.
- The goal is to thoroughly examine the DApp to ensure its security, correctness, and compliance.

### Level Three: Formal Verification

- This level is specialized and aims to provide full assurance of critical aspects of applications through formal verification of smart contracts.
- Formal verification ensures that the smart contract aligns with the specific business or technical requirements defined at the outset.
- It involves a rigorous and mathematically-based verification process, providing a high level of confidence in the smart contract's correctness and behavior.

## Benefits of Certification

Certification brings several benefits to both smart contract developers and end-users:

- **Correctness, Compliance, and Consistency:** Certification ensures that DApps meet the specified requirements and follow best practices, enhancing their overall quality.
- **Absence of Security Vulnerabilities:** Certified DApps are guaranteed to be free from common security vulnerabilities, making them more robust and reliable.
- **User Assurance:** By auditing the specifications, design, and ideation phases, evidence is presented to the community that the DApp will work as expected, increasing user confidence.
- **Reassurance for Users:** The certification status will be integrated into the dAppStore, allowing users to view the certification level of each DApp, enabling them to make informed decisions based on quality and safety.

## Integration with the dAppStore

The certification program will be integrated with the new dAppStore on Cardano. Users will be able to access the dAppStore and the accompanying light wallet through a web browser. The dAppStore will provide cryptographically secure non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that offer evidence of the certification level for each DApp. Users can browse through the store and see the certification status, ensuring transparency and ease of access to certified DApps.

## Future Plans for Certification

The certification program is an ongoing initiative with ambitious plans for the future:

- **Industry Support:** Cardano aims to gain support from the industry for emerging standards of certification.
- **Articulating Best Practices:** Cardano plans to work with partners and stakeholders to define new standards and practices for certification.
- **Certification of First DApps:** The ecosystem of partners will work together to certify the first DApps on Cardano, promoting security and trust in the ecosystem.

Cardano acknowledges that there are technical challenges to address, such as versioning of DApps and their packaging for automated tooling. However, the collaboration with partners and the community will drive Cardano towards becoming a secure platform with high-quality applications built on top of it.
